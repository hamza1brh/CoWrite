## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**CoWrite** is a sophisticated real-time collaborative document editor built specifically to demonstrate advanced integration of **Meta's Lexical editor** — the same technology powering Facebook's content creation tools. This project showcases enterprise-level implementation patterns I developed while integrating Lexical into **LambdaX**, a contract lifecycle management platform at **Cognitus** (SAP Gold Partner).

> **For Void Agency Team**: This repository demonstrates production-ready React patterns, real-time collaboration architecture, and advanced text editor customization that directly translates to modern web application development.

## 💼 **Professional Context**

### **LambdaX Integration Experience**
During my tenure at **Cognitus** (SAP Gold Partner), I led the integration of Lexical into **LambdaX**, a contract lifecycle management platform serving enterprise clients. Key accomplishments:

- **Custom Legal Document Nodes**: Built specialized Lexical nodes for contract clauses, signatures, and legal annotations
- **Collaboration Features**: Implemented real-time editing for legal teams with audit trails
- **Performance Optimization**: Handled documents with 100+ pages and multiple concurrent editors
- **Compliance Integration**: Built features meeting SOC 2 and legal industry standards

### **Technical Challenges Solved**
- **Plugin Architecture**: Designed reusable plugin system for different document types
- **State Synchronization**: Implemented conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- **Custom Serialization**: Built JSON-to-legal-document transformation pipeline
- **Performance**: Optimized for large documents with complex formatting

---

## 🔧 **Development Highlights**

### **Custom Lexical Plugin Development**
```typescript
// Example: Custom AI Assistant Plugin
export function AIAssistantPlugin(): React.JSX.Element {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();
  
  const handleAIGeneration = useCallback(() => {
    editor.update(() => {
      const selection = $getSelection();
      // Custom AI integration logic
    });
  }, [editor]);

  return <AIAssistantUI onGenerate={handleAIGeneration} />;
}
```

### **Real-time Collaboration Implementation**
```typescript
// Efficient conflict resolution for collaborative editing
const handleRemoteChanges = useCallback((changes: EditorState) => {
  editor.setEditorState(changes, {
    tag: 'collaboration',
  });
}, [editor]);
```
